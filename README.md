# luminews-test

This is a submission test for luminews.   
First thing first you could run docker-compose up for the database.   
Then open your favourite dbeaver or db gui(dbeaver/heidisql)   
open up mysql.sql and runs to create table   
then go onto luminews-test folder and run npm i then npm run start   
you could check the postman collection provided as well.   
Sorry this project could be better but i just recover from covid and done it in a day
